    </div>
    <p>Currently studying at <strong>grit:lab</strong> to become a full stack developer.</p>

    <p>What draws me to programming is the challenge and creativity of problem-solving — breaking down complex issues into smaller, meaningful building blocks that work together to solve real problems.</p>

    <p>I enjoy exploring new ideas and technologies and am constantly developing my skills across the full stack. Whether it’s building intuitive user interfaces or designing the logic behind the scenes, I strive to write clean, purposeful code that fits into the bigger picture.</p>

    <p>I'm excited to keep learning, building, and collaborating on projects that help me grow and make a meaningful impact.</p>

        This project generates images by simulating how light rays interact with 3D objects before reaching the camera. 
        Using mathematical models, the program traces light as it bounces off or passes through objects, accumulating color along the way. 
        This technique is called <strong>ray tracing</strong>, and it aims to mimic how light behaves in the real world.
      </p>
      
      <p>It supports basic shapes such as spheres, cubes, planes, and cylinders, with materials that control how light behaves:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Diffuse</strong> — scatters light in many directions</li>
        <li><strong>Reflectivity</strong> — reflects light like a mirror</li>
        <li><strong>Transparency</strong> — allows light to pass through</li>
        <li><strong>Index of Refraction</strong> — bends light depending on material</li>
        <li><strong>Emissive</strong> — emits light from the object itself</li>
      </ul>

        Ever been stuck in traffic wondering what’s causing the jam?
        I made better use of my time and simulated how we might get rid of it.
        (Just kidding—I’m still waiting too.)
      </p>

      <p>
        This Rust project simulates a smart intersection system designed to manage the flow of autonomous vehicles (AVs). 
        The simulation uses a Crossing Manager that assigns time slots to approaching vehicles, 
        coordinating their movements to safely and efficiently cross the intersection without collisions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead of relying on traditional traffic signals, the Crossing Manager divides the intersection’s conflict area into collision zones.
        Vehicles are given specific entry times into these zones, ensuring that no two vehicles occupy the same zone at the same time.
        This models how future AV-dominated road systems could operate using precise timing and spatial awareness.
      </p>

      <p>
        The project is implemented in Rust with real-time visualization using SDL2, providing an interactive view of the system’s behavior.

        Ålands Idrott faced a tough problem: 
        their funding data is spread across two different systems, making data driven decisions a real headache.
      </p>

      <p>
        During the first grit:lab hackathon, the Ålands Idrott x Consilia Data Analysis Challenge, 
        our team — Ekaterina Abrakhova, Othmane Afilali and Allen Leeyn — spent four sleepless days designing a solution.
        While I tackled the data reconciliation layer, Othmane crafted the UI and charts, 
        and Ekaterina tested for functionality and seamless user experience. 
      </p>
        <p>We built a lightweight local web app that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reconciles club data from two sources (with different schemas and IDs)</li>
            <li>Processes the data into funding statistics for budgeting and auditability</li>
            <li>Allows users to enter or change values for budget calculation</li>
            <li>Visualizes distributions through clear dashboards</li>
        </ul>
