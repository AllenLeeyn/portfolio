    </div>
    <p>Currently studying at <strong>grit:lab</strong> to become a full stack developer.</p>

    <p>What draws me to programming is the <strong>challenge and creativity of problem-solving</strong> — 
      breaking down complex issues into smaller, <strong>meaningful building blocks</strong> that work together <strong>to solve real problems.</strong></p>

    <p>I enjoy <strong>exploring new ideas and technologies</strong> and am constantly developing my skills across the full stack. 
      Whether it’s <strong>building intuitive user interfaces</strong> or <strong>designing the logic behind the scenes</strong>, I strive to write clean, purposeful code that fits into the bigger picture.</p>

    <p>I'm excited to keep learning, building, and collaborating on projects that help me grow and make a <strong>meaningful impact.</strong></p>
