  <h4>Unique Gameplay</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>After 2 minutes, spikes activate to increase tension on the board.</li>
    <li>If you lose all your lives, you become a ghost and can haunt other players.</li>
    <li>Designed for both desktop and mobile with smooth touch controls.</li>
  </ul>


  <h4>Challenges</h4>
  <p>
    Developing a real-time multiplayer game required careful handling of synchronization, concurrency, and maintaining consistent 60 FPS performance. While performance was critical, we also focused on visuals, UI design, and cross-browser consistency.
